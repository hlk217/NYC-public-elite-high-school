Improving diversity of NYC's elite public high schools


This is a Kaggle challenge. Aiming to help an not-for-profit organization (PASSNYC) determine which schools need their services the most.

New York City is home to some of the most impressive educational institutions in the world, yet in recent years, the City’s specialized high schools - institutions with historically transformative impact on student outcomes - have seen a shift toward more homogeneous student body demographics.


How can we identify students within New York City’s under-performing school districts ? 
By focusing efforts in under-performing areas that are historically underrepresented in SHSAT registration, PASSNYC will help pave the path to specialized high schools for a more diverse group of students.
